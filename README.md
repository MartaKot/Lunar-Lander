# Lunar-Lander
The project is a game created as a task for my studies. It's an application with simple graphics interface, handling animations and has an offline/online modes. It's also a little bit modified compared to the original version of the game.

# Starting new game
To run the game in offline mode, go to out/artifacts/Klient_jar and start the ProjektLunarLander.jar file. To run online mode, repeat the above and also go to out/artifacts/Serwer_jar and start the ProjektLunarLander.jar file. 

# Game rules
The goal of the game is to land on a flat surface of the planet without a collision. To move the rocket use arrow keys. You can move left, right and downwards. The rocket has a fuel tank, and as long as there is fuel, the player can move the rocket. After using all the fuel, the rocket will start to fall freely. To land successfully a proper speed must be maintained. Unsuccessful landing results in a loss of life. Losing all your lives ends the game. 

# Score
The score depends on how fast the player managed to land and how many lives were preserved.
